      <h1>Fountain of Youth?</h1>
      <p>As you hurry up the stairs, the smell from earlier gets even stronger.  At the top, right before the stairs back down, is a small crack in the wall where a mysterious, foul smelling liquid is slowly dipping from.  You feel nauseous being so close to such a smell.  The liquid looks to be a dark brown mixture of water and something else.</p>
