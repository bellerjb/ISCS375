      <h1>Mouse Trap</h1>
      <p>As you follow the motion, you see the tip of a tail slide into the door to your side.  In front of you is another passageway with a small amount of light peeking through.  You start to smell the same odor you found in the entrance.  A small crack in the floor causes you to lose your balance, but you manage to keep yourself upright.  The air is getting harder to breathe.</p>
