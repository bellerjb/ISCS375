      <h1>The Metal Door</h1>
      <p>With all of your might, you push the metal door, but it does not move.  You say your prayers and the realize that there is a small hole in the door.  Without hesitation, you slip your hand into the hole and pull the door open with ease.  Even thousands of years ago, bad design was still a problem.  After you jump in, you slam the door behind you.  You are probably safe for now.</p>
