      <h1>Decision Time Already?</h1>
      <p>Through the door leaves you in a simple room.  The light from your flashlight illuminates the stone walls made of perfectly cut cubes.  The exit is to your left, but there is also a small hole in the wall in front of you.  You could probably slip through the hole, but it would not be very comfortable.  There is a strange smell coming from the ceiling.  The elements have definitely taken their toll on this structure.</p>
