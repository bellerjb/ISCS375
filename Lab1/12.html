      <h1>More Noise</h1>
      <p>The room next to the staircase feels unsettling.  The noise from earlier is now louder.  There is a deep feeling of regret going over you right now.  You should not be here.  You need to leave.  You see only one new door.  To your right is a small opening to a new room.  The new room is different with marble floors instead of the more regular stone.</p>
