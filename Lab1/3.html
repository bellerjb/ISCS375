      <h1>Probably a Mouse</h1>
      <p>This new room is larger.  Three doorways, two portside and one in front of you, all present themselves to you.  The farmost door to your left features a crumbling staircase, while the closer one seems to be another simple walkway. The <a href="-1.html"><span>gash of metal</span></a> from the previous room bleeds in through the wall.  Suddenly, you hear another snap echo through the left doors although it is unclear which one.</p>
      <a href="4.html">&#9656; <span>Go up the Staircase</span></a><br>
      <a href="12.html">&#9656; <span>Go to the Left</span></a><br>
      <a href="16.html">&#9656; <span>Continue Forward</span></a><br>
      <a href="2a.html">&#9656; <span>Go Back</span></a><br>
