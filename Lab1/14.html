      <h1>Faster </h1>
      <p>With all of your might, you bolt as far as you can.  The marble room leads into another stone room.  As you continue to run with the spirit right on your tail you trip.  The ghost stops and looks onto you almost in pity.  You throw your book and flashlight at it.  The ghost turns and you get up and continue running.  Room after room, the doors keep getting smaller.</p>
