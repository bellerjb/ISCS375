      <p>In only darkness you hit the final door.  As you dive through its miniscule opening, you slide into a metal plate.  You are in a metal box no more than four feet by four feet.  The ghost simply phases through the wall.  "<i>You have made a costly mistake,</i>" it repeats.  "<i>You shall leave now.</i>"  Suddenly you feel the walls to your sides start to push.  The walls begin to slowly close in on you.  The ghost phases back out as the small opening shuts and you are crushed in the darkness.</p>
