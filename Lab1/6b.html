      <h1>The Hole</h1>
      <p>You walk into a tall room.  Light bleeds in up above from a small hole that seems strangely familiar.  To the right is an opening.  You now fear you might be lost, alas, there is still hope as the temple is not very large.  Surely the treasure must be somewhere.</p>
